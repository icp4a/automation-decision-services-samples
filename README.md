There are three main directories:

  - **Archives**: Decision services that you can run directly in an Automation Decision Services runtime.
  - **Decisionservices**: Decision services in compressed files that you can import directly into Decision Designer, the development environment in Automation Decision Services.
  - **Samples**: Tutorials and samples that you can use in Automation Decision Services. The tutorials provide
 detailed step-by-step instructions on specific features in Automation Decision Services, including Decision Designer and the external libraries. The samples provide code to use in Automation Decision Services.

Note that the [**Open Prediction Service Hub repository**](https://github.com/IBM/open-prediction-service-hub) contains material and guidelines related to implementing the Open Prediction Service API services.
