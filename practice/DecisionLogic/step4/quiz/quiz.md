Let us check whether you successfully solved the previous step. The correct answer unlocks the next step.

Consider a numeric decision node `amount`. This node depends on a numeric node `age`. The decision logic of `amount` uses Policy `Sum all values` and has the following behavior:

- If age is at least 20, 11 is added to amount.
- If age is at least 50, 22 is added to amount.
- If age is at least 80, 33 is added to amount.

This decision logic has an overlapping and incomplete rule set, but no default rule. Which value is obtained if age is 10?

1. [Amount has value 0.](answerZero.md)
2. [Amount has value 66.](answer66.md)
3. [Amount is undefined.](answerUndefined.md)
