# Decision services files

The archives in this repository contain sample decision services. You can import these samples directly into Decision Designer, which points directly to this directory (see `Creating decision services`[![CP4BA](/resources/cloudpak4ba.svg "IBM Cloud Pak for Business Automation")](https://www.ibm.com/docs/en/cloud-paks/cp-biz-automation/23.0.1?topic=services-creating-decision)[![ADS](/resources/ads.svg "IBM Automation Decision Services")](https://www.ibm.com/docs/en/ads/23.0.1?topic=services-creating-decision)).

The Training sample contains several decision services that introduce you to the main concepts of Automation Decision Services: business rules, data management, decision diagrams, decision tables, interaction policies and task models. The sample includes a series of decision models that gradually increase in complexity.
