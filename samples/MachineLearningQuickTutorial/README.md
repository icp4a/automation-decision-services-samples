# Tutorial Quick: Using machine learning to make better decisions

## Description



This tutorial shows you how to connect an existing predictive model to a machine learning model deployed with a PMML file in an Automation Decision Services Machine Learning Service, and use it in a decision service that validates loans. The decision service uses a decision model to apply policies and incorporate a risk prediction. These tutorial tasks are illustrated in the following diagram.

## Prerequisites

Prepare with the following resources:
- `Getting started in Automation Decision Services`[![CP4BA](/resources/cloudpak4ba.svg "IBM Cloud Pak for Business Automation")](https://www.ibm.com/docs/en/cloud-paks/cp-biz-automation/24.0.1?topic=resources-getting-started)[![ADS](/resources/ads.svg "IBM Automation Decision Services")](https://www.ibm.com/docs/en/ads/24.0.1?topic=resources-getting-started): This tutorial introduces you to Automation Decision Services.
- [Open Prediction Service API (OPS)](https://github.com/IBM/open-prediction-service-hub): This service allows to discover, manage and run models and deployments of a Machine Learning provider.

You must have the following environments:
- **Decision Designer**: A web-based user interface for developing decision services. You work with the sample decision service by importing it into a project and opening it in Decision Designer.
- **Automation Decision Services Machine Learning Service**: A Machine Learning service implementation based on IBM Open Prediction Service API.

In this tutorial, you...
- Define a machine learning provider in a project.
- Upload a machine learning model by uploading a PMML file. 
- Connect a predictive model to a machine learning model.


# Task 1: Defining a machine learning provider

**About this task**

In this task, you...
- Import and explore a sample decision service.
- Define a machine learning provider using Open Prediction Service.

## Step 1: Importing the sample decision service in Decision Designer

You import the sample decision service into a project. This decision service applies several criteria in determining a borrowerâ€™s eligibility for a loan.
One of the key factors is risk which is predicted by the machine learning model.

**Procedure**

1. Use the credentials provided for your instance to sign in to Decision Designer.
2. Create a new project and import the `Machine learning quick tutorial - Loan approval` sample from the list of Discovery tutorials. 
3. Click `Quick machine learning loan approval` to open the decision service.

**Discovery**

Take a moment to look at the imported decision service.

1. Open the `Loan Validation Data` data model in the `Data` tab to browse the defined types. <br>
   The `risk probabilities` type is used by the predictive model.
2. Click on the project name in the breadcrumbs and open the decision model `Loan Validation Decision Model`: it decides if a loan can be given to a borrower. One of the key decision is the risk computed in
the `Risk Score` node. It takes as input a prediction node corresponding to the `loan risk score` predictive model. 
3. Click **Quick machine learning loan approval** in the breadcrumbs and open the predictive model `loan risk score`. It is not yet connected, you'll connect it in the next steps.
4. Click on the `Input mapping` node and look at the input mapping rule: it defines the machine learning model input from a loan and a borrower.
5. Click on the `Output mapping` node and look at the output mapping rule: it defines a risk probability from the output of the machine learning model.

Next you will define a machine learning provider to connect the predictive model.


## Step 2: Defining a machine learning provider

You create a machine learning provider to get your model deployment into your project. See `Managing machine learning providers`[![CP4BA](/resources/cloudpak4ba.svg "IBM Cloud Pak for Business Automation")](https://www.ibm.com/docs/en/cloud-paks/cp-biz-automation/24.0.1?topic=learning-managing-local-machine-providers)[![ADS](/resources/ads.svg "IBM Automation Decision Services")](https://www.ibm.com/docs/en/ads/24.0.1?topic=learning-managing-local-machine-providers) for more information.

**Procedure**

1. Go back to the diagram and click in the diagram outside any node or link.
2. Click on the **Configure** button. You see that no provider is defined.
3. By default, **Remote Machine Learning Model** is selected. Click on **Next** 
4. Click on **New provider** to define one.
5. Click on **New +** to open the Machine Learning provider wizard:
   * Select `Open Prediction Service` as the type.
   * Set `ops-quick` as the name.
   * Enter the description: `Provider for the machine learning quick tutorial`.
   * Enter the URL of your Open Prediction Service instance. Click on the `Test connection` button. It should successfully connect.
   * Click on **Save** to add this provider. Wait for the Status to be Running to have this provider ready to be used in your project.
6. In the Navigation history click on `loan risk score` to go back to the predictive model.

Next you will connect your predictive model.

# Task 2: Uploading a PMML file and connecting a predictive model

**About this task**

In this task, you...
- Upload a PMML file into Decision Designer.
- Connect a predictive model to a machine learning model.

## Step 1: Uploading a PMML file 

You upload a PMML file to create a machine learning model deployment.

**Procedure**

1. Following Task 1, you are in the **Configure predictive model** wizard.
2. Click on **Select provider** and select the `ops-quick` provider you defined in Task 1. You can see all the machine learning models deployed on this provider.
3. Click Upload and select the PMML file provided in [`automation-decision-services-samples/samples/MachineLearningQuickTutorial/model/ML-Sample-SGDClassifier-StandardScaler-pmml.xml`](model/ML-Sample-SGDClassifier-StandardScaler-pmml.xml). 
4. Click on Upload. A new machine learning model deployment is added: Click **Back**, expand `SGDClassifier` a deployment `SGDClassifier` is ready to be used. 

Next you connect the predictive model to this machine learning model deployment.

## Step 2: Connecting a predictive model

You go on connecting the predictive model.

**Procedure**

1. Following Step 1, you are in the **Configure predictive model** wizard.
2. In the `Select machine learning model deployment` part select the deployment `SGDClassifier`.
3. Click **Next** to define the model input schema: it is complete, just browse it.
4. Click **Next** to define the test invocation. Click **Run** at the right of the wizard to validate the model. You get the following output:
```json
{
    "result": {
        "predicted_paymentDefault": 1,
        "probability_0": 0.17825993285555797,
        "probability_1": 0.821740067144442
    }
}
```
5. Click **Next** to define the model output schema. Select **Generate from test output**. Wait for the output schema to be generated and click on **OK**.
6. Click **Apply** to connect the predictive model to this machine learning model deployment. 

Next you run your predictive model and the decision model that calls it.

# Task 3: Running a predictive model and a decision model

**About this task**

In this task, you...
- Run a predictive model.
- Run a decision model calling a prediction node.

## Step 1: Running a predictive model 

You run the predictive model you connected in Task2.

**Procedure**
1. Following Task2, you are in the `loan risk score` diagram editor. Click on the Run tab. Two data sets are defined.
2. Select `John good score` and click on **Run**. The result is
```
{
    "paymentDefault": 0,
    "probability": 1
}
```
There is no default payment risk with a probability of 1.

3. Browse the Run history to see the executed rules.

Next you run the decision model calling this predictive model.

## Step 2: Running a decision model 

You run the decision model using the predictive model you just defined. 

**Procedure**
1. Following Step1, you are in the `loan risk score` Run tab. 
2. In the Navigation history, select `Loan Validation Decision Model`. 
3. Click on the Run tab and run the dataset `John Good Score`. You get the following results:
![Results image](images/result.png)
4. Browse the run history: the loan risk score rule has been triggered, the predictive model called the machine learning model deployment.
