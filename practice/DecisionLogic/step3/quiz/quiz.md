Consider a single-valued decision node `message` of type `string`. This node depends on node `sensor format`.

Node `message` should have the value “No camera can be proposed” if `sensor format` is undefined, the value “Proposing a full-frame camera” if `sensor format` is Full-frame, and the value “A camera can be proposed” as default value. What can be said about the rules that determine a value for `message` if the order of rules should not matter?
