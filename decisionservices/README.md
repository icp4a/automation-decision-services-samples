# Decision services files

The archives in this repository contain sample decision services. You can import these samples directly into Decision Designer,
 which points directly to this directory (see [Importing and exporting decision services](https://www.ibm.com/docs/en/cloud-paks/cp-biz-automation/21.0.3?topic=decisions-importing-exporting-decision-services)).

The Training sample contains several decision services that introduce you to the main concepts of Automation Decision Services: business rules, data management, decision diagrams, decision tables, interaction policies and task models. The sample includes a series of decision models that gradually increase in complexity.

**Note:** Those archives were generated with the 21.0.3 IFIX0010 version of Automation Decision Services. To be able to compile them on a newer iFix version, you will first need to import them into Decision Designer
