# Short Tutorial: Using machine learning to make better decisions

## Description


This tutorial shows you how to connect an existing predictive model to a Watson Machine Learning model and use it in a decision service that validates loans. The decision service uses a decision model to apply policies and incorporate a risk prediction. These tutorial tasks are illustrated in the following diagram.

# Task 1: Creating a deployment space in Watson Studio.

**About this task**

In this task, you...
- create an empty deployment space in Watson Studio

**Procedure**
1. You create a deployment space in Watson Studio following the WS [documentation](https://dataplatform.cloud.ibm.com/docs/content/wsj/analyze-data/ml-spaces_local.html?context=cpdaas&audience=wdp).
2. You get the data from Watson Studio that is required to define a machine learning provider in your decision project in Task 2. You need:
* the space id which is defined in the deployment space settings.
* the base URL of the Watson Machine Learning API endpoint. For instance `https://<location>.ml.cloud.ibm.com/ml/v4`.
* the authentication URL. For instance `https://iam.bluemix.net/identity/token`.

You also require an API key that you take from your [cloud account](https://cloud.ibm.com/iam/apikeys).

# Task 2: Defining a machine learning provider in Decision Designer

**About this task**

In this task, you...
- Import and explore a sample decision service.
- Define a machine learning provider using Watson Machine Learning.

## Step 1: Importing the sample decision service in Decision Designer

You import a sample decision service into a project. This decision service applies several criteria in determining a borrowerâ€™s eligibility for a loan.
One of the key factors is risk which is predicted by the machine learning model.

**Procedure**

1. Use the credentials provided for your instance to sign in to Decision Designer.
2. Create a new project and import the `Machine learning short tutorial - Loan approval` sample from the list of Discovery tutorials.
3. Click `Short machine learning loan approval` to open the decision service.

**Discovery**

Take a moment to look at the imported decision service.

1. Open the `Loan Validation Data` data model in the `Data` tab to browse the defined types. <br>
   The `risk probabilities` type is used by the predictive model.
2. Click `Short machine learning loan approval` in the breadcrumbs and open the decision model `Loan Validation Decision Model`: it decides if a loan can be given to a borrower. One of the key decision is the risk computed in the `Risk Score` node. It takes as input a prediction node corresponding to the `loan risk score` predictive model.
3. Click `Short machine learning loan approval` in the breadcrumbs and open the predictive model `loan risk score`. It is not yet connected, you'll connect it in next steps.
4. Click on the `Input mapping` node and look at the input mapping rule: it defines the machine learning model input from a loan and a borrower.
5. Click on the `Output mapping` node and look at the output mapping rule: it defines a risk probability from the output of the machine learning model.

Next you will define a machine learning provider to connect the predictive model.

## Step 2: Defining a machine learning provider 

You create a machine learning provider to get your model deployment into your decision project. See `Managing machine learning providers`[![CP4BA](/resources/cloudpak4ba.svg "IBM Cloud Pak for Business Automation")](https://www.ibm.com/docs/en/cloud-paks/cp-biz-automation/25.0.0?topic=learning-managing-local-machine-providers)[![ADS](/resources/ads.svg "IBM Automation Decision Services")](https://www.ibm.com/docs/en/ads/25.0.0?topic=learning-managing-local-machine-providers) for more information.

**Procedure**

1. Go back to the diagram and click in the diagram outside any node or link.
2. Click on the **Configure** button. Keep **Remote Machine Learning Model** selected. 
3. Click **Next** to select a provider. You see that no provider is defined. 
4. Click on **New provider** to define one. 
5. Click on **New +** to open the Machine Learning provider wizard:
   * Keep `Watson ML` as the type.
   * Set `wml-short` as the name.
   * Enter the description: `Provider for the machine learning short tutorial`.
   * Enter the following service credentials you get in Task 1 from Watson Studio to authenticate with your Watson Machine Learning service instance:
       * API key.
       * Space ID.
       * URL.
       * Authentication URL.
    Click on the `Test connection` button. It should successfully connect.
   * Click on **Save** to add this provider. Wait for the Status to be Running to have this provider ready to be used in your project.
6. Click on loan risk score in the navigation history to go back to the predictive model.

Next you will connect your predictive model.

# Task 3: Uploading a PMML file and connecting a predictive model

**About this task**

In this task, you...
- Upload a PMML file to create a machine learning model deployment.
- Connect a predictive model to a machine learning model.

**Procedure**

1. Following Task 2, you are in the **Configure predictive model** wizard.
2. Click on **Select provider and deployment** and select the `wml-short` provider you defined in Task 2.
3. Click `Upload` and add the PMML file provided in [`automation-decision-services-samples/samples/MachineLearningQuickTutorial/model/ML-Sample-SGDClassifier-StandardScaler-pmml.xml`](model/ML-Sample-SGDClassifier-StandardScaler-pmml.xml). 
4. Click on `Upload`. A new machine learning model deployment is added and selected. You are redirected to the next step to define the input schema.
4. Check the input schema: it is complete, just browse it.
5. Click **Next** to define the test invocation. Click **Run** at the right of the wizard to validate the model. You get the following output:
```json
{
    "fields": [
        "probability_0",
        "probability_1",
        "predicted_paymentDefault"
    ],
    "values": [
        [
            0.17825993285555802,
            0.821740067144442,
            1
        ]
    ]
}
```
The values may differ because the precision is not the same each time.

6. Click **Next** to define the model output schema. Select **Generate from test output**. Wait for the output schema to be generated and click on **OK**.
7. Click **Apply** to connect the predictive model to this provider. 

Next you run your predictive model and the decision model that calls it.
 
 # Task 4: Running a predictive model and a decision model
 
 **About this task**
 
 In this task, you...
 - Run a predictive model.
 - Run a decision model calling a prediction node.
 
 ## Step 1: Running a predictive model 
 
 You run the predictive model you connected in Task 2.
 
 **Procedure**
 1. Following Task 3, you are in the `loan risk score` diagram editor. Click on the Run tab. Two data sets are defined.
 2. Select `John good score` and click on **Run**. The result is
 ```
 {
  "paymentDefault": 0,
  "probability": 1
}
 ```
 There is no default payment risk with a probability of 1.
 
 3. Browse the Run history to see the executed rules.
 
 Next you run the decision model calling this predictive model.
 
 ## Step 2: Running a decision model 
 
 You run the decision model using the predictive model you just defined. 
 
 **Procedure**
 1. Following Step1, you are in the `loan risk score` Run tab. 
 2. In the Navigation history, select `Loan Validation Decision Model`.
 6. Click on the Run tab and run the data set `John Good Score`. The loan is approved.
 7. Browse the run history: the loan risk score rule has been triggered, the predictive model has called the machine learning model deployment.
