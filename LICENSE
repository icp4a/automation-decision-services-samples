IMPORTANT: READ CAREFULLY

Two license agreements are presented below.

1. IBM International License Agreement for Evaluation of Programs
2. IBM International Program License Agreement

If Licensee is obtaining the Program for purposes of productive use (other than evaluation, testing, trial "try or buy," or demonstration): By clicking on the "Accept" button below, Licensee accepts the IBM International Program License Agreement, without modification.

If Licensee is obtaining the Program for the purpose of evaluation, testing, trial "try or buy," or demonstration (collectively, an "Evaluation"): By clicking on the "Accept" button below, Licensee accepts both (i) the IBM International License Agreement for Evaluation of Programs (the "Evaluation License"), without modification; and (ii) the IBM International Program License Agreement (the "IPLA"), without modification.

The Evaluation License will apply during the term of Licensee's Evaluation.

The IPLA will automatically apply if Licensee elects to retain the Program after the Evaluation (or obtain additional copies of the Program for use after the Evaluation) by entering into a procurement agreement (e.g., the IBM International Passport Advantage or the IBM Passport Advantage Express agreements).

The Evaluation License and the IPLA are not in effect concurrently; neither modifies the other; and each is independent of the other.

The complete text of each of these two license agreements follow.

LICENSE INFORMATION

The Programs listed below are licensed under the following License Information terms and conditions in addition to the Program license terms previously agreed to by Client and IBM. If Client does not have previously agreed to license terms in effect for the Program, the International License Agreement for Evaluation of Programs (i125-5543-06) applies.

Program Name (Program Number):
IBM Automation Decision Services 24.0.1 (Evaluation)

The following standard terms apply to Licensee's use of the Program.

Evaluation Period

The evaluation period begins on the date that Licensee agrees to the terms of this Agreement and ends after 90 days.

Multi-Product Install Image

The Program is provided as part of a multi-product install image. Licensee is authorized to install and use only the Program (and its Bundled or Supporting Programs, if any) for which a valid entitlement is obtained and may not install or use any of the other software included in the image unless Licensee has acquired separate entitlements for that other software.

Supporting Programs

Licensee is authorized to install and use the Supporting Programs identified below only to support Licensee's use of the Principal Program under this Agreement. The phrase "to support Licensee's use" would only include those uses that are necessary or otherwise directly related to a licensed use of the Principal Program or another Supporting Program. The Supporting Programs may not be used for any other purpose. A Supporting Program may be accompanied by license terms, and those terms, if any, apply to Licensee's use of that Supporting Program. In the event of conflict, the terms in this License Information document supersede the Supporting Program's terms. Licensee must obtain sufficient entitlements to the Program, as a whole, to cover Licensee's installation and use of all of the Supporting Programs, unless separate entitlements are provided within this License Information document. For example, if this Program were licensed on a VPC (Virtual Processor Core) basis and Licensee were to install the Principal Program or a Supporting Program on a 10 VPC machine and another Supporting Program on a second 10 VPC machine, Licensee would be required to obtain 20 VPC entitlements to the Program.

Supporting Programs:
IBM WebSphere Application Server Liberty

Modifiable Third Party Code

To the extent, if any, in the NOTICES file IBM identifies third party code as "Modifiable Third Party Code," IBM authorizes Licensee to 1) modify the Modifiable Third Party Code and 2) reverse engineer the Program modules that directly interface with the Modifiable Third Party Code provided that it is only for the purpose of debugging Licensee's modifications to such third party code. IBM's service and support obligations, if any, apply only to the unmodified Program.

Separately Licensed Code

Each of the components listed in the NON_IBM_LICENSE file is considered "Separately Licensed Code" licensed to Licensee under the terms of the applicable third party license agreement(s) set forth in the NON_IBM_LICENSE file(s) that accompanies the Program, and not this Agreement. Future Program updates or fixes may contain additional Separately Licensed Code. Such additional Separately Licensed Code and related licenses are listed in the applicable NON_IBM_LICENSE file that accompanies the Program update or fix. 

Note: Notwithstanding any of the terms in the third party license agreement, the Agreement, or any other agreement Licensee may have with IBM, with respect to the Separately Licensed Code: 
(a) IBM provides it to Licensee WITHOUT WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND AND DISCLAIMS ANY AND ALL EXPRESS AND IMPLIED WARRANTIES AND CONDITIONS INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE WARRANTY OF TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT OR NON-INTERFERENCE, AND THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES AND CONDITIONS OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE;
(b) IBM is not liable for any direct, indirect, incidental, special, exemplary, punitive or consequential damages including, but not limited to, lost data, lost savings, and lost profits.

The following units of measure may apply to Licensee's use of the Program.

Establishment

Establishment is a unit of measure by which the Program can be licensed. An Establishment is a single physical site, including the surrounding campus and satellite offices located within 50 kilometers, of Licensee's site address. Licensee must obtain an entitlement for each Establishment at or for which the Program will be used. Licensee is permitted to deploy an unlimited number of copies of the Program within the Establishment. An entitlement for an Establishment is unique to that Establishment and may not be shared, nor may it be reassigned other than for the permanent closing of the Establishment.

Monthly API Call

Monthly API Call is a unit of measure by which the Program can be licensed. An API Call is the invocation of the Program via a programmable interface. Sufficient entitlements must be obtained to cover the maximum number of API Calls in any calendar month.

In addition to the above, the following terms apply to Licensee's use of the Program.

Cumulative Entitlements

Establishment, and Monthly API Call entitlements are not alternative means for licensing the Program. Licensee must obtain the appropriate number of Establishment entitlements as well as the appropriate number of Monthly API Call.

Use of Usage Metering Data 

The Program enables use of a usage metering dashboard (the "Dashboard") that enables the display and monitoring of certain data and metrics regarding Licensee's deployment and usage of IBM and non-IBM software programs, as well as the computing environment on which they are deployed ("Usage Metering Data"). Usage of the Dashboard requires registration on either the Red Hat Marketplace or IBM Software Central. Licensee's usage of the Dashboard and IBM's use and sharing of Usage Metering Data are governed by the terms of the Service Description for the Red Hat Marketplace, Operated by IBM, available here: https://www.ibm.com/support/customer/csol/terms?id=i126-8719, and if Licensee enables or uses the Dashboard, Licensee agrees to those terms.
