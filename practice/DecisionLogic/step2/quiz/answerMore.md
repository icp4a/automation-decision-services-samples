### Hmm, this is a strange answer!

If budgets are nonnegative, this will reduce the number of possible cases. It will also reduce the number of missing cases. Missing cases with negative budget can no longer occur and the missing rule with condition `budget is less than 0` should not be generated any more. This results in a decrease of missing rules.
